# High-Level Design (HLD) for RealtimeAPI Paper Trading Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This High-Level Design (HLD) document provides an overview of the architecture, components, and design decisions for the RealtimeAPI Paper Trading Platform. The platform is a full-stack web application that enables users to simulate cryptocurrency trading in real-time, including portfolio management, trade execution, and live market data updates.

### 1.2 Scope
The HLD covers the system's high-level architecture, key components, data flow, technology stack, and deployment strategy. It does not include low-level implementation details, code snippets, or detailed API specifications.

### 1.3 Assumptions
- The system will handle a moderate number of concurrent users (up to 1000 active users).
- External cryptocurrency price data is simulated using a helper function; in production, this would integrate with a real market data API.
- The platform operates in a single geographic region initially.
- No advanced admin features are required beyond basic user management.

## 2. System Overview

The RealtimeAPI Paper Trading Platform is designed to provide a realistic trading simulation experience for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Users can:
- Create accounts and authenticate securely.
- View and manage virtual portfolios.
- Execute buy/sell trades with simulated funds.
- Receive real-time price updates for selected cryptocurrencies.
- Track trade history and performance.

The system is built as a microservices-like architecture using containerization for easy deployment and scalability.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a client-server architecture with separation of concerns:

```

+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
```

### Key Architectural Decisions:
- **Stateless Backend**: All user sessions are managed via JWT tokens, allowing horizontal scaling.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets are used for live price updates to provide a responsive user experience.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used for packaging and deployment consistency.
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and relational data modeling.

## 4. Components

### 4.1 Frontend (React Application)
- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for authentication, dashboard, and trading interactions.
- **Key Features**:
  - Login/Signup forms
  - Protected routes for authenticated users
  - Dashboard with portfolio overview and trade forms
  - Real-time price display using WebSocket connections
- **Technologies**: React, React Router, Axios for API calls, Chart.js for data visualization.

### 4.2 Backend (FastAPI Application)
- **Purpose**: Handles business logic, API endpoints, and data processing.
- **Key Modules**:
  - **Auth Router**: User registration, login, JWT token management
  - **Trade Router**: Buy/sell trade execution with portfolio updates
  - **Portfolio Router**: Portfolio data retrieval and management
  - **WebSocket Router**: Real-time price broadcasting
- **Technologies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, Pydantic for data validation.

### 4.3 Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage for user data, portfolios, and trade history.
- **Schema**:
  - Users table: id, email, hashed_password, created_at
  - Portfolio table: id, user_id, symbol, quantity, avg_price
  - Trades table: id, user_id, symbol, trade_type, quantity, price, timestamp
- **Features**: ACID transactions, foreign key relationships, indexing for performance.

### 4.4 Real-time Service (WebSocket Handler)
- **Purpose**: Provides live cryptocurrency price updates to connected clients.
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintains active connections per ticker symbol
  - Simulates price changes and broadcasts updates every second
  - Handles connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)

### 4.5 Proxy (Nginx)
- **Purpose**: Serves static frontend files and proxies API requests.
- **Benefits**: Improved performance, security, and load balancing capabilities.

## 5. Data Flow

### 5.1 User Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials via frontend form
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/login` endpoint
3. Backend validates credentials against database
4. If valid, JWT token is generated and returned
5. Frontend stores token and redirects to dashboard

### 5.2 Trade Execution Flow
1. User submits trade form (symbol, quantity, price, type)
2. Frontend sends authenticated POST request to `/trade` endpoint
3. Backend validates trade (sufficient funds/shares, valid symbol)
4. Database transaction updates portfolio and creates trade record
5. Backend returns success/failure response
6. Frontend updates UI to reflect new portfolio state

### 5.3 Real-time Price Updates Flow
1. Frontend establishes WebSocket connection to `/ws/{ticker}`
2. Backend WebSocket handler accepts connection
3. Handler periodically fetches/simulates price data
4. Price updates are sent as JSON messages to connected clients
5. Frontend receives and displays updated prices in real-time

### 5.4 Portfolio Retrieval Flow
1. Authenticated user navigates to dashboard
2. Frontend sends GET request to portfolio endpoint
3. Backend queries database for user's holdings
4. Portfolio data is returned as JSON
5. Frontend renders portfolio table/chart
